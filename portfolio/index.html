                <p id="bio">
                    I am a second year Game Design and Developer at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). In my free
                    time, I enjoy working with animals at my local animal shelter, playing D&D with my friends, and
                    playing video games. I hope to get a portfolio website out of this class that I can use and link in
                    my resume. I want to create video games that people will enjoy. I want to learn the skills to be
                    able to create beautiful games that will bond people together. To do this, I plan on applying for
                    the Masters program along with a minor in Computer Science. I don't know exactly where I want to
                    end up at the end of my RIT career, but I hope to find out soon.
