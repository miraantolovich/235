        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <h2>Riptide</h2>
        <p>
            I am working with a team of seven other people to create <span class="italics">Riptide</span>. Riptide is an
            open-world RPG style game in the ocean where you play as a pirate ship, killing monsters and bosses while
            upgrading your ship.

        <h2>Animal Shelter Database</h2>
        <p>
            I am working alone to create a SQL Server Database that is an example of an animal shelter. It handles
            customers, animals, volunteers/employees, and medical records.
        </p>
        <h1>Academic Projects</h1>
        <p>
            I worked with a team of three other people to create <span class="italics">Captain Bobby's Revenge</span>,a
            side-scrolling shooter in Visual Studio Monogame. You play as Captain Bobby defending the world from waves
            of armed-to-the-teeth fish.

        <h1>Game Jams</h1>
        <h2>Wild MAGIC! - October 2019</h2>
        <p>
            I worked with a team of four other people to create <span class="italics">Negative Confessions</span>, a
            narrative game where you are Baby Anubis Jr. trying to figure out whether or not the people you are
            investigating are telling the truth.
        </p>
        <h2>GMTK 2019 - August 2019</h2>
        <p>
            I worked with one other person to create <span class="italics">One Moment, Please</span>, a turn-based
            strategy game. You play as a call center employee trying to answer a call before the robots get on the line.
        </p>
        <h2>RIT Game Developer's Game Jam - January 2019</h2>
        <p>
            I worked with a team of two other people to create <span class="italics">Daily Dunce</span>, a mulit-faceted
            game where you play as a drunk man going about doing daily tasks like feeding a cat and getting groceries
            (more beer).

                <p id="bio">
                    I am a second year Game Design and Developer at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). In my free
                    time, I enjoy working with animals at my local animal shelter, playing D&D with my friends, and
                    playing video games. I hope to get a portfolio website out of this class that I can use and link in
                    my resume. I want to create video games that people will enjoy. I want to learn the skills to be
                    able to create beautiful games that will bond people together. To do this, I plan on applying for
                    the Masters program along with a minor in Computer Science. I don't know exactly where I want to
                    end up at the end of my RIT career, but I hope to find out soon.
