        </p>
        <p id="bio">
            I am a second year Game Design and Developer at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). In my free
            time, I enjoy working with animals at my local animal shelter, playing D&D with my friends, and playing
            video games. I hope to get a portfolio website out of this class that I can use and link in my resume. I
            want to create video games that people will enjoy. I want to learn the skills to be able to create
            beautiful games that will bond people together. To do this, I plan on applying for the Masters program
            along with a minor in Computer Science. I don't know exactly where I want to end up at the end of my RIT
            career, but I hope to find out soon.
        </p>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
            Currently, I am working on three major projects. These range from Unity games to creating databases.
        </p>
        <h3>Riptide</h3>
        <p>
            I am working with a team of seven other people to create <span class="italics">Riptide</span>. Riptide is an
            open-world RPG style game in the ocean where you play as a pirate ship, killing monsters and bosses while
            upgrading your ship.
        </p>
        <h3>Dungeon Kill You</h3>
        <p>
            I am working with a team of three other people to create <span class="italics">Dungeon Kill You</span>. This
            is a game that is a local four-player game where one person plays as the dungeon master, trying to kill the
            dungeon explorers with traps and monsters.
        </p>
        <h3>Animal Shelter Database</h3>
        <p>
            I am working alone to create a SQL Server Database that is an example of an animal shelter. It handles
            customers, animals, volunteers/employees, and medical records.
        </p>
        <h2>Academic Projects</h2>
        <p>
            I worked with a team of three other people to create <span class="italics">Captain Bobby's Revenge</span>,a
            side-scrolling shooter in Visual Studio Monogame. You play as Captain Bobby defending the world from waves
            of armed-to-the-teeth fish.
        </p>
        <h2>Game Jams</h2>
        <h3>Wild MAGIC! - October 2019</h3>
        <p>
            I worked with a team of four other people to create <span class="italics">Negative Confessions</span>, a
            narrative game where you are Baby Anubis Jr. trying to figure out whether or not the people you are
            investigating are telling the truth.
        </p>
        <h3>GMTK 2019 - August 2019</h3>
        <p>
            I worked with one other person to create <span class="italics">One Moment, Please</span>, a turn-based
            strategy game. You play as a call center employee trying to answer a call before the robots get on the line.
        </p>
        <h3>RIT Game Developer's Game Jam - January 2019</h3>
        <p>
            I worked with a team of two other people to create <span class="italics">Daily Dunce</span>, a mulit-faceted
            game where you play as a drunk man going about doing daily tasks like feeding a cat and getting groceries
            (more beer).
