        <p>
            Wingspan is a game that focuses on being a birdwatcher.
            <blockquote>
                You are bird enthusiasts—researchers, bird watchers, ornithologists, and collectors—seeking to discover and attract the best birds to your network of 
                wildlife preserves. Each bird extends a chain of powerful combinations in one of your habitats (actions). These habitats focus on several key aspects
                of growth:
                <ul>
                    <li>Gain food tokens via custom dice in a birdfeeder dice tower</li>>
                    <li>Lay eggs using egg miniatures in a variety of colors</li>>
                    <li>Draw from hundreds of unique bird cards and play them</li>
                </ul>
                The winner is the player with the most points after 4 rounds. If you enjoy Terraforming Mars and Gizmos, we think this game will take flight at your table.
