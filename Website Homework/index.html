            <blockquote>
                You are bird enthusiasts—researchers, bird watchers, ornithologists, and collectors—seeking to discover and attract the best birds to your network of 
                wildlife preserves. Each bird extends a chain of powerful combinations in one of your habitats (actions). These habitats focus on several key aspects
                of growth:

                A stellar game and easy entry into my top five. When you've topped 100 plays in the first six months, it's no doubt that the playability
                 is off the charts. Add to it, that the artwork is incredible, and you have a real winner. <br>

                Keep thinking I'll get tired of this eventually but I think the play length/complexity is such that it'll keep me coming back for quite 
                awhile. Can generally fit this in 75-90 mins with 3-4 ppl at a casual pace.

                I enjoy this game a lot. It is beautiful while being educational. The rules are simple to grasp while still intuitive. The theme is very 
                friendly. I like the combo building with the resource management. Even some set collection and contract fulfillment built in. When you
                 "run your engine" it can be very rewarding. I think the game could use a larger variety of bird powers and secret specialties to increase
                  the re-playability though. Still, a fine game that should only get better with expansions. As it stands now, it is a little to light for 
                  my tastes as the actions become somewhat obvious and repetitious.
