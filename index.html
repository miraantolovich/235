                I am a second year Game Design and Developer at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). In my free
                time, I enjoy working with animals at my local animal shelter, playing D&D with my friends, and playing
                video games. I hope to get a portfolio website out of this class that I can use and link in my resume. I
                want to create video games that people will enjoy. I want to learn the skills to be able to create
                beautiful games that will bond people together. To do this, I plan on applying for the Masters program
                along with a minor in Computer Science. I don't know exactly where I want to end up at the end of my RIT
                career, but I hope to find out soon.
