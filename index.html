        I am a second year Game Design and Developer at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). In my free time, I
        enjoy working with animals at my local animal shelter, playing D&D with my friends, and playing video games. I
        hope to get a portfolio website out of this class that I can use and link in my resume. I want to create video
        games that families and friends can enjoy playing together. I don't know exactly where I want to end up at the
        end of my RIT career, but I hope to find out soon.
