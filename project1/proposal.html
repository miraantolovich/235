            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>
                You start off trying to run an indie game company with one employee, you can hire artists, UX designers,
                and even interns! Become excited as your games give you a wonderful fan base and dedicated employees.

            <h3>Characters</h3>
            <p>
                Tim is your first employee, they do everything right now. Please lessen their burden.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jonhathen (yes, spelled like that, he knows) is your intern that desperately wants a job. Will you give
                it to them?
            </p>
            <p>
                Rem is a programmer looking at your company. Will you be able to entice him with your first game?
            </p>
            <p>
                Yui might be your UX designer, making sure each and every product is easy to use. Can you hire them
                before any other game company snatches them up?
            </p>
            <p>
                There are so many other flavor-text characters. Play and find out!

            <h3>

            </h3>
            <p>
                Players can choose what they want to invest in (UI, Art, Sound, Design, Programmers, etc.) to balance
                out the quality of their games. You can continue to buy more and more employees, but you have to balance
                the money you are making with the salary you have to pay them.

                Teaching the Game
            </h3>
            <p>
                The game is an incremental clicker so most people will get the basic process, however, the game will
                have a beginning layover that will explain the layout and what you need to do.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Player Learning
            </h3>
            <p>
                Players need to learn how to balance the quality of games, which will increase money gained, with the
                salaries of employees.
