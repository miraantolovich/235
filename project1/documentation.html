            <h2>Process</h2>
            <h3>Day 1</h3>
            <p>
                I wrote down all the content into the GitHub content markdown file. During this time, I tried to expand 
                upon the game idea to make it a fleshed out game. Then I started writing down the HTML content into a 
                base page.
            </p>
            <h3>Day 2</h3>
            <p>
                I tried to make the base page easily usable for each different page for the website. I added more basic 
                content and semantically marked everything up like the GitHub content markdown file. I also made the pictures 
                in Piskel to mimic the style that I think the game should have.
            </p>
            <h3>Day 3</h3>
            <p>
                I finished the semantic mark-up of the HTML content for the index.html, I then started formatting the CSS in the 
                base style.css page. I tried organizing everything with a center-alignment and tried a two-color scheme. I searched 
                up how to make images have a hover effect, and the source is linked down below. I implemented this on the main page 
                and then decided I did not like the effect on the main page picture. I finished the responsiveness of the website, 
                changing the nav-bars, font-sizes, and the pictures.
            </p>
            <h3>Day 4</h3>
            <p>
                I started the three other pages with their semantic content. I made a second CSS file for the proposal page as I wanted 
                a main CSS file and a secondary CSS file for a page that needed content only for that page. During the review for my 
                website, I learned that my center-alignment for most of the content does not work. I needed to change my color scheme as 
                well. 
            </p>
            <h3>Day 5</h3>
            <p>
                I started changing the CSS, toying with alignment and lines underneath some of the headings and other content in the page. 
                I also chose a different color scheme for the website, adding two new colors to create a slightly different look. I got rid 
                of the two-color scheme for organization and made the main part of the page all one color. The background changed colors so 
                the main part of the page stands out.
            </p>
            <h3>Day 6</h3>
            <p>
                I fine-tuned the picture on the main page as it was having problems resizing itself. I expanded upon the documentation process after 
                checking the website to make sure everything was responsive.
