# Just Another Incremental Game
Topnav: Home | Proposal | Documentation | Project

Hey, you! Yeah you, I'm looking right at you. I need someone to run this company for me. Balancing salaries... creating high quality games... hiring employees... you think you can do it?
...
Cool! Let's get started.

Start out as a very basic indie game studio with one wonderful employee. Grow further and further until you have your own triple-A studio! Will you become the best game company with millions of fans? Or will you go deep into debt? It's all up to you. With a little luck and strategy, you'll have created the biggest studio in the world.

This is what the art style of the game should look like. There are example icons for buying x10, x100, artists, and programmers. There is the money icon as well.

This is what the UI should look like. There should be a bar up top with money and what your company size is. There should be a picture of a growing business in the middle. The bar on the bottom has your games and how many stars they get and the people you are able to buy currently with the ability to buy multiples.

### Sound
8-Bit Sound

Plays when: players buy big upgrades, UI buttons are clicked, and as background music.
