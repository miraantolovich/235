# Just Another Incremental Game
Topnav: Home | Proposal | Documentation | Project

Hey, you! Yeah you, I'm looking right at you. I need someone to run this company for me. Balancing salaries... creating high quality games... hiring employees... you think you can do it?
...
Cool! Let's get started.

Start out as a very basic indie game studio with one wonderful employee. Grow further and further until you have your own triple-A studio! Will you become the best game company with millions of fans? Or will you go deep into debt? It's all up to you. With a little luck and strategy, you'll have created the biggest studio in the world.
