# Just Another Incremental Game
Topnav: Home | Proposal | Documentation | Project

Hey, you! Yeah you, I'm looking right at you. I need someone to run this company for me. Balancing salaries... creating high quality games... hiring employees... you think you can do it?
...
Cool! Let's get started.

Start out as a very basic indie game studio with one wonderful employee. Grow further and further until you have your own triple-A studio! Will you become the best game company with millions of fans? Or will you go deep into debt? It's all up to you. With a little luck and strategy, you'll have created the biggest studio in the world.

This is what the UI should look like. There should be a bar up top with money and what your company size is. There should be a picture of a growing business in the middle. The bar on the bottom has your games and how many stars they get and the people you are able to buy currently with the ability to buy multiples.

### Sound
8-Bit Sound

Plays when: players buy big upgrades, UI buttons are clicked, and as background music.

## Gameplay
___
### Mechanics
Players can choose what they want to invest in (UI, Art, Sound, Design, Programmers, etc.) to balance out the quality of their games. You can continue to buy more and more employees, but you have to balance the money you are making with the salary you have to pay them.

### Controls
Mouse (main), Keyboard (secondary)

### Teaching the Game
The game is an incremental clicker so most people will get the basic process, however, the game will have a beginning layover that will explain the layout and what you need to do.

### Player Learning
Players need to learn how to balance the quality of games, which will increase money gained, with the salaries of employees.
